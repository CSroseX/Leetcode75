# Leetcode75

This repository is dedicated to documenting my journey through the [Leetcode 75 Study Plan](https://leetcode.com/studyplan/leetcode-75/). I will be posting daily coding solutions and insights as I progress through the challenges.
Although I started this journey on July 20, 2024, I am documenting it now so that I can review past learnings while solving new problems and posting previous solutions.

## Progress

I will update this section regularly to track my progress:

| Day | Problem Name | Status |
| --- | ------------ | ------ |
| 1   | Merge Strings Alternately | ✅ Done |
| 2   | Problem  | ⏳ In Progress |
| ... | ...          | ...    |

## About Leetcode 75

Leetcode 75 is a structured study plan that covers essential coding concepts and problems. It is designed to help programmers improve their problem-solving skills, which is crucial for technical interviews.

## What You’ll Find Here

- **Daily Code**: My solutions to the daily Leetcode problems.
- **Daily Learnings**: Notes, insights, and key takeaways from each day's problem.
- **Problem Links**: Links to the problems on Leetcode for reference.

## Structure

- Each folder corresponds to a day in the challenge.
- Inside each folder, you will find:
  - `solution.<ext>`: My code solution in the programming language I'm using.
  - `readme.md`: Notes and explanations about the problem and my approach.
